# eerie-data-viewer-workflows

Functions and workflows for preparing data for visualization for the EERIE project (https://eerie-project.eu/) data viewer. The input
data is read from the EERIE intake catalogues and, in the case of observations,
from netCDF files.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The EERIE data is published in almost real time and is continously updated.
It can cointain issues like inconsistent units or other encoding errors. The scripts do correct some of
the issues and homogeneize the variable names, but some issues may persist or arise as the data is updated.
If you aim to use this script and EERIE cloud data please review the results critically. Do not consider
this "production ready".

The present code is also changing and evolving. Please report any bugs you may find in the issue tracker.

The following is a schematic description of the main workflow:

- Open the intake catalogue (can be “cloud” or “levante”).
- Loop over the variables.
- Open the entry in the catalogue as an xarray dataset.
- Rename the variable if needed together with coordinates.
- Loop over the analysis dimensions (time_filter, period). For each of them compute the product, regrid to a common grid using conservative regridding, add the analysis dimensions as dimensions to the xarray dataset and append it to a list.
- Merge all the products into a single dataset and save it to netCDF using dask.
- A separate script converts the netCDFs to zarr and uploads it to the storage, defining the chunks so there is a single chunk for each map or time series.

## Instalation and configuration

It is recommended to clone the project and create a conda environment with the environment.yml file. Then
the project root can be simply added to the PYTHONPATH.

```commandline
git clone git@github.com:eerie-project/eerie-viewer-workflows.git
cd eerie-viewer-workflows
conda env create -f environment.yml -n eerieview
conda activate eerieview
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD"
cd scripts
python get_climatologies.py
```

Some environment variables have to be defined in a .env "dotfile" to be located in the project root

```
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=""
S3_KEY=""
S3_SECRET=""
S3_BUCKET="eerie"
CDO_LOCATION=""
PRODUCTSDIR=""
DIAGSDIR=""
OBSDIR=""
DOWNLOADIR=""
```

## Main scripts available

The scripts/entrypoints are in the scripts folder. For them to run the root directory needs to be in the
PYTHONPATH. The following are the main scripts:

- get_climatologies: It computes the decadal products from the EERIE data, which are climatologies but also trends.
- get_obs_climatologies: Computes climatologies and trends for observations. Currently ERA5 and AVISO data are supported. These are not read from intake catalogues but need to be present as files in the disk.
- download_era5.py: Script to download ERA5 filse
- get_monthly.eke: Computes the monthly Eddy Kinetic Energy from daily sea level data from EERIE models.
- get_aviso_monthly_variables.py: Computes monthly data from the AVISO observations.
- get_time_series: Computes regionally averaged time series from EERIE data
- get_obs_time_series: Computes regionally averaged time series from the observations.
- upload_to_zarr.py: get_climatologies.py et al. generate netCDF files. This scripts merges them and uploads them to an object storage as zarr datasets.
- plot_stripes.py: This script is used for Quality Control. It generates figures by systematically reading all the fields from the zarr files, in order to inspect them looking for gaps or suspicious patterns.

## Workflow for developers/contributors

For best experience create a new conda environment (e.g. DEVELOP) with Python 3.11:

```
conda create -n DEVELOP -c conda-forge python=3.11
conda activate DEVELOP
```

Before pushing to GitHub, run the following commands:

1. Update conda environment: `make conda-env-update`
1. Install this package: `pip install -e .`
1. Run quality assurance checks: `make qa`
1. Run tests: `make unit-tests`
1. Run the static type checker: `make type-check`
